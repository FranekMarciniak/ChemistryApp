## About The Project

This is fullstack app created because my really good friend asked me to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Purpose of this is app is simple, create equations and learn by solving them. <br />
It uses react with materialUI on the frontend and node with express for the backend. I also store everything in mongodb atlas database.
### Built With

Technologies I used to develop this project

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://mongoosejs.com/s)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

## What I learned

Doing this project I learned a lot!!! This is my third time doing backend stuff, and I feel like I'm starting to understand more and more about it. <br />
 I used styled components for the first time and I absolutely love scoped css, maybe mixing it with materialUI was not a great idea. <br />
 Also, I have two regrets, first, I've should used typescript, in a project this size keeping track of types gets hard. <br />
 Second, I've should used some kind of state management library, something like mobx or redux instead of contexAPI. <br />
